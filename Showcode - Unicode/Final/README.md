The University of Bath ranked in the top 5 in our league, and so the top 10 coders within the University of Bath (myself included) were able to progress to the final, a 3-part coding challenge against the other top university teams from all leagues.

In the end, Bath came 7th out of the 80 universities taking part overall, and 20 universities in the final.

## My personal score in the final: 80%
