# Unicode 20/21

## Introduction

The Unicode competition involves 84 teams (mostly universities) that compete head-to-head in coding challenges.

There are 6 leagues of 14 teams each.

## How often are the challenges?

The challenges are once a fortnight, over a period of 6 months, making 13 challenges in total.

## How long do the challenges take?

Each challenge is designed to take around an hour to complete.

## What programming languages can you use?

There are 15 languages you can complete the challenges in, including R, C++, Javascript, Python etc.

I chose **Python** for all the challenges in this competition as I wanted to get more exposure and practice using it in a time-sensitive and problem-solving environment.

## How do you win?

Your score is calculated by running your code through some hidden tests, giving you a percentage of tests passed. If two coders have the same score, the one with the faster time will appear above in the leaderboard.

Each challenge, your team plays against a new team within your league. The top 10 scores from each team for that challenge are combined and the team with the highest score wins!

## Grand finale

After the 13 challenges are done, the top 10 coders in the top 5 teams in each league will battle it out for the top spot!
